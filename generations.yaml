    description: "The Subaru B9 Tribeca, as it was initially named, represented Subaru's first entry into the mid-size crossover SUV segment and its first vehicle to offer seating for up to seven passengers. Built on a modified version of the Subaru Legacy/Outback platform, the Tribeca featured highly distinctive styling with a controversial front end design incorporating a triangular grille and swept-back headlights inspired by Subaru's aviation heritage. Measuring approximately 189.8 inches in length, the Tribeca was significantly larger than any previous Subaru model. Powered exclusively by a 3.0-liter flat-six 'boxer' engine producing 245 horsepower and 215 lb-ft of torque, the Tribeca came standard with Subaru's symmetrical all-wheel drive system paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured an avant-garde design with a flowing, wave-like dashboard, a central information display, and available features including leather upholstery, heated seats, a navigation system, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system. Available in five and seven-seat configurations, the Tribeca offered reasonably spacious accommodations in the first and second rows, though the optional third row was suitable mainly for children or short trips. Safety features included standard stability control, anti-lock brakes, and a comprehensive array of airbags. Despite its innovative design and capable all-wheel drive system, the initial Tribeca faced criticism for its polarizing styling, relatively modest power for its size, and tight third-row accommodations compared to competitors, leading to sales figures that fell short of Subaru's expectations."

    description: "Following lukewarm reception to the original design, Subaru implemented a comprehensive facelift for the 2008 model year, dropping the 'B9' prefix and simply calling the vehicle 'Tribeca.' The most significant change was a complete redesign of the front end, replacing the distinctive but controversial triangular grille with a more conventional design featuring a chrome bar and hexagonal opening more consistent with other Subaru models. The rear styling was also updated with revised taillights and bumper design. Mechanically, the 3.0-liter flat-six engine was replaced by a new 3.6-liter version producing 256 horsepower and 247 lb-ft of torque, addressing criticism of the original model's modest power while maintaining similar fuel economy. The five-speed automatic transmission was revised for smoother operation and better responsiveness. Interior changes were more subtle, focusing on improved materials and minor ergonomic refinements, while maintaining the distinctive wave-like dashboard design. The seating configuration continued to offer five and seven-passenger options, with slight revisions to improve third-row access and comfort, though space remained tight compared to many competitors. Throughout the remainder of its production run, the Tribeca received only minor updates to equipment and features, gradually falling behind the rapidly evolving mid-size crossover segment in technology and design. Despite the improvements, the Tribeca never achieved the sales success Subaru had hoped for, leading to its discontinuation after the 2014 model year without an immediate replacement. The experience gained from the Tribeca, however, would later inform the development of the more successful Subaru Ascent, which would return the brand to the three-row SUV segment in 2019 with a more conventional design and feature set better aligned with market expectations."
